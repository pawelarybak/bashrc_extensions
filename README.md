# bashrc_extensions
This project adds aliases for tools I often use. For now it is django and git, but hopefully this list will be longer in future.
Apart from aliases it also adds autocomplete for django and for my new git alias - `g`.
## TODO
- Speed up django autocomplete. It's frustrating
- More fancy aliases for git
- More fancy aliases for django
- More tools (?)
